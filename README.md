root@debain:/ # 



###set up mysql part
root@debian:/# mysql -p
>Enter password: 

mysql&#62; CREATE USER 'sshrank'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'blargpass';
>Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql&#62; CREATE DATABASE db_sshrank;

mysql&#62; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db_sshrank.* TO sshrank@localhost;
>Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> exit
Bye


### now for git/pythong/andmoresql

```
user@debian:~$ cd
user@debian:~$ mkdir git
user@debian:~$ cd git
user@debian:~/git$ git clone https://github.com/pronto/SSH-Ranking && cd SSH-Ranking
Cloning into 'SSH-Ranking'...

user@debian:~/git/SSH-Ranking$ 
```


Now edit the sqlclass.py
looking for line:
```python
eng = sqlalchemy.create_engine('mysql://sshrank:blargpass@localhost')
```
change it so its ('enginetype://username:password@sqlloc')  for more info look up SQL-Alchemy

now do:
```
user@debian:~/git/SSH-Ranking$ python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Jan  2 2013, 13:56:14) 
[GCC 4.7.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from sqlclass import *
>>> exit
```


### check the mysql tables:
```
user@debian:~$ mysql -u sshrank -A db_sshrank -p
Enter password: 
mysql> show tables;
+----------------------+
| Tables_in_db_sshrank |
+----------------------+
| ips_alc2             |
| rdns_tbl             |
+----------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```


## Now you should be able to start watching!
for now you have to run sshrank.py under tmux/screen
```
root@debian:/home/user/git/SSH-Ranking# python ./sshrank.py -f on -w on
root
doing 1st run! yay!
Elapsed time was 5.91278e-05 seconds


==========Now Watching the logfile========
['::1', 'klfsjakl', '2013-11-13 12:59:01']
['::1', 'klfsjakl', '2013-11-13 12:59:05']
['192.168.1.50', 'kjskfjask', '2013-11-13 12:59:37']
['192.168.1.50', 'kjskfjask', '2013-11-13 12:59:41']
```
those four entries are just test ones i did



## now for the webUI
the very last line on  web/serv.py you might need to edit if you dont want to run the web script as root
```python
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0',debug=False, port=80)
    ```
    just get rid of the ', port=80' part


    this should also be run under screen/tmux


    now if you get all this you sould be able to go to http://<ip of serve>:<port>
    eg http://127.0.0.1:5000/

    and you should see the webui! :D
